The coding studies and contents we did with three different groups between the ages of 8-12 before the pandemic period are shared here. These topics were discussed voluntarily in two of these groups. Lessons are planned for 2 hours per week.

The curricula used are open source, translated from English, rearranged to suit age groups and supported with slides.

The examples on the  <a href="https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/s/en/home" target="_blank">Google CS First</a> page have been carefully examined and arranged in terms of the integration of primary school children with the world. I was very impressed by the excitement and desire to learn of children in this age range.

For more advanced block coding hardware applications, mBlock and Arduino were preferred and sample applications were made. Robotic coding can also be started at this stage.

Applications developed by us have been tested and are working. Not all of the applications we have included as examples have been tested.

I hope it will be useful to those interested...
